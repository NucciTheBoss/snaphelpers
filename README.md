# snaphelpers

A [Lua](https://www.lua.org) module for interfacing with the
snap API from within a snap. Level up your hooks and wrappers by being able
to quickly access configuration options and application properties without
requiring a smörgåsbord of complex and difficult to maintain shell scripts!
